This is the official website for the Gemini Simulator project. Originally founded by graduate students at NTNU Norway.
The Gemini Simulator project aims to become a fully fledged simulator for testing and verifying algorithm and systems
for autonomous vessels. This is done through emulation of EMR sensors (Electromagnetic radiation) such as 
cameras, LiDAR and radar. Furthermore, we will provide an API designed to work with 
[Open Simulation Platform](https://opensimulationplatform.com/) which can handle vessel physics and system emulation.
